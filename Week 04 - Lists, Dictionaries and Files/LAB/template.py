# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Bring back check_record(value, limit) and print_report(...) from Week 3
#    (copy them, or rewrite them - either is fine). check_record returns
#    difference, percent and status. print_report does all of the printing,
#    nothing outside it should contain a print() of its own. Give each a
#    one-line docstring.

# your function(s) go here

def check_record(value, limit):
    """Calculate the difference, percentage and status."""
    difference = value - limit

    if limit == 0:
        percent = 0
    else:
        percent = (value / limit) * 100

    if value > limit:
        status = "OVER LIMIT"
    else:
        status = "OK"

    return difference, percent, status

def print_report(label, value, limit, difference, percent, status):
    """Print one report for a sever."""

    print(
        f"{label}: {value} GB used / {limit} GB total, "
        f"difference: {difference} GB, "
        f"usage: {percent:.1f}%, status: {status}"
    )


# ====================================================================== STORE
# 2. Get your records into a list of dicts, each shaped like:
#        {"label": ..., "value": ..., "limit": ...}
#
#    Threshold : write the list directly in the code - at least 3 records.
#    Typical   : instead, write a function load_records(path) that reads
#                label,value,limit lines from a file and returns the list.
#                Make your own data file, one record per line.
#    Excellent : also write the results out to a new file (one line per
#                record: label, status), as well as printing them.

records = []   # replace with your code


# =============================================================== PROCESS + OUTPUT
# 3. Loop over records. For each one, call check_record and print_report.
#
#    Excellent : also keep a running count of how many were OVER LIMIT, and
#                print that once, after the loop ends.

# your loop goes here


# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it and check every record's numbers are correct by hand
#    [ ] If you are loading from a file, check what happens when the file
#        does not exist - write the error down
#    [ ] Check every function still does one job
